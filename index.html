          The purpose of this visualization portfolio is to explore electoral and financial data germane to US
          House of Representatives elections in the state of Texas. Although Texas has been a reliable Republican
          stronghold for many years, rapid demographic change has raised Democrats' hopes that they may be able to
          compete in 2020 and beyond. Democrats flipped 2 US House seats in the 2018 midterms and will likely attempt
          to expand their success in the current cycle.

          <h4>Visualization 1: County-level results by year</h4>
          <p>
            The first visualization is a simple line chart of a series of election-related measures for counties in
            each of 4 major metro areas in Texas (Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio). The x-axis encodes time,
            running from 2002-2018, and the y-axis captures the percent of citizens or voters in each county that
            either was registered to vote, turned out to vote, or voted for the Democratic candidate in each cycle
            since 2002. You can toggle the data displayed by the chart by updating the selections below the plot area,
            and highlight a particular county and display its name by hovering over the corresponding line.
          </p>
          <h6>County-level <span id="viz1-metric-title">percent of Democratic vote share</span> for the <span id="viz1-area-title">Austin</span> metro region</h6>
          <div id="viz1"></div>
          <label for="viz1-metric">Choose a metric:</label>
          <select id="viz1-metric" onchange="updateViz1()">
            <option value="demperc">Percent vote Democratic</option>
            <option value="regperc">Percent of county registered</option>
            <option value="toperc">Percent of registered turnout</option>
          </select>
          <label for="viz1-area">Choose a metro region:</label>
          <select id="viz1-area" onchange="updateViz1()">
            <option value="Austin">Austin</option>

            <option value="Houston">Houston</option>
            <option value="San Antonio">San Antonio</option>
          </select>
          <p>Data source: <a href="ftp://ftpgis1.tlc.texas.gov/elections">Texas Secretary of State election data</a></p>
          <p>
            A few key patterns are immediately discernible. In all 4 metro areas, turnout is highly cyclical, with
            more than 60% of voters turning out in presidential election years and often less than 40% turning out
            in midterm years. A key exception is 2018: in all 4 metro areas, the dropoff from 2016 to 2018 turnout
            was markedly less than the dropoff between previous presidential and midterm cycles, speaking to high
            voter enthusiasm that year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most metro areas also show an increase in voter registration over time, with the counties in the San
            Antonio area having consistently the highest registration percentages. As far as percentage support for
            Democratic House candidates, it's worth noting that the largest county in all 4 metro areas (Travis County
            in Austin, Dallas County in Dallas, Harris County in Houston, and Bexar County in San Antonio) exhibited
            the most positive growth in Democratic vote share from 2002-2018, indicating that Democrats are consolidating
            their support in major population centers while staying largely static (or even losing votes) in less-populated
            rural and exurban areas.

          <h4>Visualization 2: County-level results by year and demographic</h4>
          <p>
            The second visualization is a scatter plot in which each dot represents a county in Texas. Dot size represents
            county population, fill color encodes percent of vote received by the Democratic candidate for US House in the
            given cycle (as does relative position in the vertical direction), while position in the horizontal direction
            represents a county-level demographic measure (either percent of population white or median age). There is a
            tooltip available that displays these metrics in detail by hovering over a county's dot. To change the election
            cycle or the demographic measure of interest, use the drop-down menus below the chart.

          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most intriguing trends in the data can be observed by comparing the 2002 plot
            against the 2018 plot for both demographic measures. In 2002, the data are much more evenly
            dispersed across the domain of the plot: there appears to be no serious correlations between
            county population, median age, and proportion white and that county's propensity to vote Democratic.
            However, in 2018, a stark trend is observable: smaller, whiter, and older counties are much more
            likely to vote Republican, while larger, more diverse, and younger counties opt for Democrats.
            Counties appear to have begun sorting themselves by the elections of 2008 and 2010, with the new
            partisan alignments in full swing by 2012.

          <h4>Visualization 3: Composition of campaign contributions</h4>
          <p>
            The third and final visualization examines campaign finance data for major-party (Democratic and Republican)
            candidates for US House in Texas, for all campaign cycles 1988-2018. The visualization progressively disaggregates
            all campaign receipts by party, district, candidate, and type (individual giving from private citizens and a catch-
            all "other" category that includes campaign and corporate donations). You can hover over any distinct path with any
            number of layers in the sunburst to see the campaign receipts associated with that path in nominal same-year dollars.
            Colors encode information about the selected path: red represents Republicans and blue represents Democrats; dark indigo
            represents "other" receipts while light purple represents individual giving; and district numbers take on a chromatic
            yellow-orange scale to visually distinguish individual races. Candidates are all represented by light gray because there
            are too many distinct candidates over 30 cycles (well into the hundreds) to meaningfully encode them using color. You can
            interact with the graphic by selecting an election cycle or a different hierarchy of disaggregations in the menus below
            the graph. The disaggregation hierarchy allows you to explore contribution breakdowns in different orders.

            Progressively moving through election cycles using the Party-Type-District-Candidate hierarchy reveals that
            Democrats had the fundraising advantage in the 1980s and early 1990s, but Republicans overtook them by the mid-90s
            and enjoyed a 2-to-1 and even nearly 3-to-1 advantage throughout the 2000s and into the mid-2010s. Democrats nearly
            caught them in the 2018 cycle, however, with the help of an absolutely massive individual contribution fundraising haul.
